## Assumptions Table

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Impact if Wrong | Validation Method |
|----|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| A-001 | <statement> | High/Medium/Low | <what breaks> | <how to verify> |
| A-002 | <statement> | High/Medium/Low | <what breaks> | <how to verify> |
| A-003 | <statement> | High/Medium/Low | <what breaks> | <how to verify> |

## High Confidence Assumptions

Assumptions we're confident about (validated or obvious):

- **A-001:** <assumption> — Validated by <source/evidence>

---

## Medium Confidence Assumptions

Assumptions that seem reasonable but need validation:

- **A-002:** <assumption> — Should validate by <method>

---

## Low Confidence Assumptions

Assumptions we made to proceed but are uncertain about:

- **A-003:** <assumption> — Risk: <what could go wrong>
