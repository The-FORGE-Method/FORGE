## Purpose

This document defines the **product intent** — what we're building and why.

---

## Required Content

When populated, this document should include:

### 1. Vision Statement
- What is this product?
- What problem does it solve?
- Who is it for?

### 2. Success Criteria
- How do we know when MVP is complete?
- What metrics matter?
- What does "done" look like?

### 3. Scope Boundaries
- What is explicitly IN scope?
- What is explicitly OUT of scope?
- What is deferred to future phases?

### 4. User Value
- Primary user benefit
- Why would someone use this over alternatives?

---

## How to Populate

### From Product Intent Packet (Recommended)

If a Product Intent Packet exists in `inbox/10_product-intent/`:

1. Review the Product Intent Packet (especially `intent.md`)
2. Resolve any blocking questions in `open-questions.md`
3. Refine the intent into this constitutional document
4. Human Lead approves before Execute

### From Other Sources

1. Human Lead provides Frame Artifact or North Star document
2. Or architect authors during Refine phase
3. Human Lead approves before Execute

### Relationship to Product Intent Packets

- **Product Intent Packets** are Frame-phase discovery artifacts (`inbox/10_product-intent/`)
- **This document (PRODUCT.md)** is the refined constitutional specification
- Packets **precede and inform** this document
- Packets are preserved as historical record; this document is the current authority

---

## Until Populated

**CC must not scaffold or begin execution.**
