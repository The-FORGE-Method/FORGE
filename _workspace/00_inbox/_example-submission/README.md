# Feature Request: Example Submission

> **NOTE:** This is an example folder showing proper submission structure.
> Delete this folder or rename the slug when submitting a real feature.

---

## Summary

[2-3 sentences describing the feature you want]

Example: "Add a notification system that alerts users when their feature request status changes. This should integrate with the existing pipeline and send updates at each phase transition."

## Problem

[What problem does this solve? Why is it needed?]

Example: "Currently, users who submit feature requests have no visibility into pipeline progress without manually running `/forge-rd status`. This creates uncertainty and requires constant checking."

## Proposed Approach (Optional)

[If you have ideas on how to solve it, include them here]

Example:
- Add webhook support to state.json transitions
- Create email/Slack notification templates
- Allow users to configure notification preferences

## Materials Included

List all files you've included:

- `threads/ideation-transcript.md` — Initial brainstorm conversation
- `assets/wireframe-sketch.png` — UI concept sketch

## Submitter

[Your name/role or agent name]
