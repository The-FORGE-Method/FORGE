## Q1: Phase 0 Invocation Model

Should Phase 0 (scaffold verification) be @G's automatic first step after @C completes, or explicitly invoked?

- **A: Automatic** — Every @C-to-@F transition triggers Phase 0 verification via @G (recommended)
- **B: Explicit** — Human or agent must run `@G phase0` command
- **C: Human-initiated** — Human runs scaffold check manually

## Q2: Backward Compatibility

Are existing projects (created before hardening) required to comply with new gates?

- **A: Yes** — Migrate all existing projects to comply
- **B: No** — Grandfather existing projects; new gates apply only to new projects (recommended)
- **C: Opt-in** — Provide migration guide, let projects choose

## Q3: Stakeholder Model Scope

Is STAKEHOLDER-MODEL.md required if a project has auth but no distinct stakeholder actors?

- **A: Yes always** — Required for any project with auth
- **B: No** — Only required if stakeholder actors exist in PRODUCT.md (recommended)
- **C: Optional** — Recommended but not enforced

## Q4: Zero-Test Detection Method

Should "zero tests = failure" check for test file existence, test runner output, or both?

- **A: File existence only** — Check for *.test.* / *.spec.* files
- **B: Test runner output only** — Verify `pnpm test` reports actual test execution
- **C: Both** — Check file existence AND verify test runner executes them (recommended)

## Q5: PR-000 Test Setup Exception

How is the test infrastructure setup handoff (PR-000) identified so @E can skip the test-infra gate?

- **A: Flag in handoff** — Handoff packet includes `is_test_setup: true` field (recommended)
- **B: Manual @E decision** — @E decides based on handoff content
- **C: @G identification** — @G marks it based on Build Plan position

## Q6: Pre-Flight Report Generation

Should Phase 0 preflight reports be auto-generated by @G?

- **A: Auto-generated** — @G produces preflight-checklist.md automatically after checks (recommended)
- **B: Manual** — Human or agent fills in template
- **C: Template-based** — Template provided, agent fills it

## Q7: Stakeholder Model Validation

What validation level for STAKEHOLDER-MODEL.md?

- **A: Schema validation** — Required fields must be present and non-empty (recommended)
- **B: Manual review only** — Human reviews, no automated check
- **C: No validation** — Existence check only

## Q8: Auth ADR Scope

Auth architecture ADR required for which projects?

- **A: All with any auth** — Even single-user apps
- **B: Multi-user/role projects only** — Projects with roles, permissions, or multi-tenancy (recommended)
- **C: Stakeholder projects only** — Only when distinct stakeholder actors exist

## Q9: Phase 0 Failure Recovery

If Phase 0 scaffold verification fails, who fixes it?

- **A: @C re-runs** — @C (Commit) re-executes scaffolding
- **B: Human fixes** — Human manually corrects structure
- **C: @G reports + stops** — @G produces failure report, human decides next action (recommended)

## Q10: Enforcement Matrix Location

Should the enforcement matrix (which agent enforces what, when, failure mode) live in canon or operations?

- **A: Core canon** — In method/core/ as canonical rules
- **B: Operations manual** — In method/core/forge-operations.md as operational reference
- **C: Split** — Core rules in forge-core.md, detailed matrix in forge-operations.md (recommended)
