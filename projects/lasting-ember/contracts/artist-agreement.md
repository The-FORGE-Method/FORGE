- The right to perform the Tracks live
- The right to release the Tracks on streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) for consumer listening
- The right to sell the Tracks directly to consumers (downloads, physical media)
- Moral rights where applicable

### 3.3 License Duration
This grant is **perpetual** and irrevocable for the term of this Agreement, meaning it continues indefinitely unless terminated under Section 9.

### 3.4 Non-Exclusive Carve-Outs
Artist may grant non-exclusive sync licenses directly **only** with prior written approval from Lasting Ember, to avoid conflicts with existing or pending licenses.

---

## 4. Revenue Share

### 4.1 Default Revenue Split
Unless otherwise specified, revenue from sync licenses shall be split as follows:

| Party | Share |
|-------|-------|
| Artist | **[50]%** |
| Lasting Ember | **[50]%** |

*This split applies to all license fees, royalties, and other compensation received from Licensees.*

### 4.2 Custom Revenue Terms
Alternative revenue shares may be negotiated and documented in **Schedule A** attached to this Agreement.

### 4.3 Payment Terms
- Payments are made **[monthly/quarterly]** for the preceding period
- Minimum payout threshold: **$[50]**
- Payments via [direct deposit/PayPal/preferred method]
- Artist receives itemized statement showing all licenses issued and revenue earned

### 4.4 No Backend Royalties
Sync license fees under this Agreement are **flat fees**. There are no ongoing royalty obligations to Artist beyond the initial revenue share, unless specifically negotiated.

---

## 5. Buyout Option

### 5.1 One-Time Buyout Alternative
At the time of Track submission (or by subsequent amendment), Artist may elect a **one-time buyout payment** instead of ongoing revenue share:

**Buyout Amount:** $__________

### 5.2 Effect of Buyout
If Artist accepts a buyout:
- Artist receives the full buyout amount upon Track acceptance
- Artist waives all future revenue share for that Track
- All other terms of this Agreement remain in effect
- Lasting Ember retains exclusive sync licensing rights perpetually

### 5.3 Buyout Availability
Buyout offers are made at Lasting Ember's discretion and may vary based on Track quality, exclusivity, and market potential.

---

## 6. Performing Rights Organizations (PROs)

### 6.1 PRO Registration Restriction

- ASCAP
- BMI
- SESAC
- GMR

- Or any international equivalent

### 6.2 Reason for Restriction
This restriction exists because:
- Our Licensees expect "cleared" music with no additional fees
- PRO registration creates backend royalty obligations that conflict with our flat-fee licensing model
- Unexpected PRO claims damage Licensee relationships and our platform reputation

### 6.3 Existing PRO Registration
If any Track is already registered with a PRO:
- Artist must disclose this **before** submission
- Artist must withdraw the Track from PRO registration, OR
- The Track may be accepted under modified terms (reduced revenue share to account for PRO complications)

### 6.4 Consequences of Violation
If Lasting Ember or any Licensee incurs costs due to undisclosed PRO claims:
- Artist shall reimburse all costs incurred
- The Track may be removed from the catalog
- This may constitute a material breach under Section 9
