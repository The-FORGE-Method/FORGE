## Part 3: Artist Buyout Pricing

### 3.1 The Buyout Model

Artists can sell tracks outright for one-time payment instead of revenue share. This:
- Gives artists immediate income
- Converts variable liability to fixed asset cost
- Provides exclusive rights for premium pricing

### 3.2 Recommended Buyout Rates

| Track Quality | Non-Exclusive Buyout | Exclusive Buyout | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Standard** | $50-100 | $150-300 | Background music, simple production |
| **Premium** | $150-300 | $400-800 | Full arrangement, high production |
| **Signature** | $300-500 | $800-1,500 | Exceptional tracks, recognizable |
| **Stems Bundle** | +50% | +75% | Includes multitrack stems |

### 3.3 Buyout Economics

**Break-even Analysis (vs 50% revenue share):**

For a track generating $X/year in licensing revenue:
- Our 50% share = $0.50X annually
- Buyout NPV at 3-year horizon, 10% discount = ~$1.24X

**Recommended buyout formula:**
```
Buyout Price = (Estimated Annual Revenue × 1.5) to (× 2.5)
```

**Example:**
- Track earning $100/year → Buyout at $150-250
- Track earning $500/year → Buyout at $750-1,250

### 3.4 Buyout Offer Strategy

1. **Data-Driven Offers** - Use streaming/licensing data to predict value
2. **Tiered Invitations** - Invite top performers for exclusive buyouts
3. **Catalog Acquisition** - Bulk deals with retiring artists/small labels
4. **Genre Gaps** - Premium buyouts for underrepresented genres

## Part 4: Radio Station Pricing

### 4.1 Consumer Tiers

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free (Ad-Supported)** | $0 | Standard quality, 4 ads/hour, limited skips |
| **Premium** | $4.99/mo | High quality, no ads, unlimited skips |
| **Premium Family** | $7.99/mo | Up to 5 accounts |

### 4.2 Advertising Rates

**Industry Benchmark CPMs (Cost Per 1,000 Impressions):**
| Ad Type | Industry Average | Our Target |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| Audio (15-30 sec) | $15-25 CPM | $18 CPM |
| Display (in-app) | $5-10 CPM | $8 CPM |
| Sponsored Segment | $25-50 CPM | $35 CPM |

**Revenue Calculation:**
```
Free User Value = (Listens/month × Ads/listen × CPM) / 1000

Example: 20 hours × 4 ads/hr × $18 CPM / 1000 = $1.44/user/month
```

### 4.3 B2B Licensing (Radio-in-a-Box)

| Package | Monthly | Features |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Starter** | $99/mo | 1 stream, 10K listener-hours |
| **Professional** | $299/mo | 3 streams, 50K listener-hours |
