## 3. Rights & Ownership Considerations

### Key Terms of Service Findings (Updated Nov 6, 2025)

#### Ownership by Tier:

**Free/Basic Users:**
> "You covenant and agree that you will only use Outputs generated from Submissions made by you through the Service solely for your lawful, internal, personal and **non-commercial purposes**, provided that you give attribution credit to Suno in each case."

**Pro/Premier Subscribers:**
> "Suno hereby **assigns to you all of its right, title and interest** in and to any Output owned by Suno and generated from Submissions made by you through the Service during the term of your paid-tier subscription."

#### Critical Caveats:

1. **No Copyright Guarantee:**
> "Due to the nature of machine learning, Suno makes no representation or warranty to you that any copyright will vest in any Output."

2. **Training License:**
Users grant Suno perpetual license to use content for training/improving their AI.

3. **Remixes Are Joint Works:**
If remix features are enabled, remixes are "jointly and equally owned" by both parties.

4. **Competition Restriction:**
> "In no event will you use the Output to compete with Suno, including to create a competing product or service."

5. **No AI Training:**
> Users cannot "use the Services (and any Output) to create, develop or improve any competing products or services or to power, enable or train other artificial intelligence and machine learning models."

### Implications for Lasting Ember:

✅ **Pro/Premier subscribers own their content** and can license it commercially
✅ **Clear chain of ownership** for paid users
⚠️ **Copyright uncertainty** - Suno doesn't guarantee copyright protection
⚠️ **Free users cannot license commercially** - must verify paid status
⚠️ **Need to verify original creation** - not remixes of others' work

### Recommended Vetting Process:
1. Verify artist has Pro or Premier subscription
2. Confirm song was created during paid subscription period
3. Check if song is a remix (joint ownership issues)
4. Get written confirmation that lyrics/prompts were original
5. Advise artists of copyright uncertainty in any licensing agreement

## 8. Risk Considerations

1. **Copyright Uncertainty**: Suno explicitly doesn't guarantee copyright vests in Output
2. **Terms Changes**: Suno may modify commercial rights at any time
3. **Training Data Lawsuits**: Ongoing industry litigation could affect AI music rights
4. **Platform Dependency**: If Suno restricts commercial licensing, strategy fails
5. **Competition**: Other platforms may emerge as preferred AI music tools

**Mitigation:**
- Stay current with Suno ToS changes
- Build relationships with multiple AI music platforms (Udio, etc.)
- Structure licensing agreements to address copyright uncertainty
- Develop educational content that establishes authority regardless of platform
